Scribit is a feature-rich sketch pad app built with SwiftUI, leveraging the power of PencilKit to provide a natural and responsive drawing experience. 
The app allows users to draw add draggable shapes, draggable text, and enjoy a fully functional undo/redo system. 
This project serves as a great example of integrating UIKit components like PencilKit with SwiftUI for a modern iOS application.

## Features

- **Login and sign up:** This app uses firebase authentication to log in and sign up users.
- **Drawing Tools:** Use the PencilKit drawing tools with a custom tool picker interface.
- **Shapes and Texts:** Add and drag shapes or text around the canvas with ease.
- **Undo/Redo Support:** Comprehensive undo/redo functionality for all canvas actions.
- **Zoom & Pan:** Utilize pinch-to-zoom and pan functionality for a closer look at your drawings.
- **Save canvas to gallery:** Scribit allows users save their drawings as images to their gallery.
